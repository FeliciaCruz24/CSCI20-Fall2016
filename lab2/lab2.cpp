// The computer will choose between 2 numbers to randomly output.
//The numbers are 4 and 9. Variables will be randomNum1 and randomNum2.
//At the top of the screen the computer will say "Guess a number between 1 and 10".
//Underneath there will be a text box where the user types thir guess.
// User types their guess and if the number is lower the program will say "lower" or if the number is higher it will say "higher".
//If the user guesses correctly they will win ten points.
// If they do not guess the right number they will lose one point starting from 10 till they get the right answer. Variable will be int losePoint = 10; The equation wll be: losePoint= losePoint -1; 
// They will continue to guess till the get the right answer.
